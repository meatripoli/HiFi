# HiFi Employee Record Database

## Project Story

As a record store owner with multiple store locations, I would like a website where my employees can look up an album and see the stock count of each store.

As only employees will be able to access the record search, a password is required for logging in.

## Setup

After being added to the Github repository, use the following command to clone HiFi and initialize the app:

```
  git clone https://github.com/meatripoli/HiFi.git
  cd HiFi
  npm init
```

### Install Dependencies

Project dependencies

`npm install dotenv express express-session mysql2 passport passport-local sequelize`

Dev dependencies

`npm install chai chai-http eslint mocha prettier`

### Configure Environment Variables

The required environmental variables are contained in a `.env` file you must create at the **project root.** To do so, copy the `.env-sample` as `.env` and add your local configuration values.

Note: the MYSQL-\* envarrs do not require surrounding quote marks

- MYSQL_KEY=yourMySqlDbPassword
- MYSQL_DBNAME=yourMySqlDbName
